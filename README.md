# generalizability

The code simulates an randomized control trial data and a reference probability sample, and applies weighting and prediction approaches to generalizaing causal evaluations to the target population. Specifically, the estimand of interest in the population average treatment effect on the treated. 

The methods are decribed in the paper: Elliott, M. R., O. Carroll, R. Grieve, and J. Carpenter (2023). Improving transportability of randomized controlled trial inference using robust prediction methods. Statistical Methods in Medical Research 32(12), 2365â€“2385.
